    # Allocates money between different parties without losing pennies.
    # After the mathematical split has been performed, leftover pennies will
    # be distributed round-robin amongst the parties. This means that parties
    # listed first will likely receive more pennies than ones that are listed later
    #
    # @param [Array<Numeric>] splits [0.50, 0.25, 0.25] to give 50% of the cash to party1, 25% to party2, and 25% to party3.

    #
    # @example
    #   Money.new(5,   "USD").allocate([0.3, 0.7])         #=> [Money.new(2), Money.new(3)]
    #   Money.new(100, "USD").allocate([0.33, 0.33, 0.33]) #=> [Money.new(34), Money.new(33), Money.new(33)]
